Creating time:
Use strong field validation so that anyone can’t enter any random data.
Use strong authentication and authorization so that only authenticated users can perform their authorized tasks.
Don’t expose more data than necessary.
Throw right exceptions with related HTTP status-code so that users can use them in their own way or in case of exception it can show other releted data.

Consuming:

Try to fetch the data as less no of times as possible.
Verify the source of data whether it is from an authenticated or not.
